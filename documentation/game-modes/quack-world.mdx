## Managing Your Duck Collection

As your character explores Quack World, you'll build and manage a collection of unique ducks, each with their own characteristics and abilities.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your Eggs">
    Use your character to purchase eggs from the marketplace. Each egg belongs to a specific Duck Cycle, determining certain attribute ranges and special characteristics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nurture Your Eggs">
    Through your character, care for your eggs by feeding and maintaining them until they reach level 1. Well-cared-for eggs are essential for hatching.
  </Step>
  <Step title="The Hatching">
    Once your eggs reach level 1 and meet all care requirements, they're ready to hatch instantly!
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Ducks">
    Upon hatching, you'll be presented with 9 unique ducks in sets of 3. Choose wisely - once you pass on a set, those ducks become inaccessible.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Train and Develop">
    Your character trains and develops each duck, preparing them for battles in other game modes like Quack Ball, Quack Tower Defense, and Quack Chase.
