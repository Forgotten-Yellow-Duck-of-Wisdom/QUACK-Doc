# Quack World: Your Ducks' Journey

<Note>
  The Quack World is the foundation of the Quack universe, where your ducks grow, develop, and prepare for all other game modes.
</Note>

## From Egg to Duck

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your Eggs">
    Purchase eggs from our marketplace. Each egg belongs to a specific Duck Cycle, determining certain attribute ranges and special characteristics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nurture Your Eggs">
    Care for your eggs by feeding and maintaining them until they reach level 1. Well-cared-for eggs are essential for hatching.
  </Step>
  <Step title="The Hatching">
    Once your eggs reach level 1 and meet all care requirements, they're ready to hatch instantly!
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Ducks">
    Upon hatching, you'll be presented with 9 unique ducks in sets of 3. Choose wisely - once you pass on a set, those ducks become inaccessible.
  </Step>
