# Global Game: Your Duck's Journey

<Note>
  The Global Game is the foundation of the Quack universe, where your duck grows, develops, and prepares for all other game modes.
</Note>

## From Egg to Duck

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your Egg">
    Purchase your egg from our marketplace. Each egg belongs to a specific Duck Cycle, determining certain attribute ranges and special characteristics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nurture Your Egg">
    Care for your egg by feeding and maintaining it until it reaches level 1. A well-cared-for egg is essential for hatching.
  </Step>
  <Step title="The Hatching">
    Once your egg reaches level 1 and meets all care requirements, it's ready to hatch instantly!
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Duck">
    Upon hatching, you'll be presented with 9 unique ducks in sets of 3. Choose wisely - once you pass on a set, those ducks become inaccessible.
  </Step>
