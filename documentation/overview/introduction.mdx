# Welcome to Quack World.

Quack is a complete gaming universe that combines MMORPG depth with multiple game modes. Create your character, build your duck collection, and experience a living world where intelligent AI NPCs remember your every interaction. From managing your personal home and completing quests in the expansive Quack World, to battling in fast-paced Quack Ball matches, defending towers in strategic warfare, or surviving chaotic arena battles in Quack Chase... Every experience is connected, every action matters, and every asset you own is truly yours.

## Why Quack Stands Out

- **Full MMORPG Experience**: Create your character, complete quests, craft items, build your home, and explore a vast world with AI NPCs that remember you
- **Four Unique Game Modes**: Master Quack World's MMORPG mechanics, compete in Quack Ball soccer matches, strategize in Quack Tower Defense, or survive in Quack Chase battle royale
- **Intelligent AI NPCs**: Experience dynamic relationships with NPCs who remember your past interactions and respond differently based on your history with them
- **Duck Collection & Training**: Build and train a collection of unique ducks, each with distinct stats and abilities that impact performance across all game modes
- **Player-Driven Economy**: Craft, buy, sell, and trade items, equipment, ducks, and blueprints in a true player-owned marketplace
- **Housing System**: Purchase, upgrade, and decorate your personal home to showcase achievements and store your collection
- **True Asset Ownership**: All eggs, ducks, and items are NFTs—truly yours to own, trade, or sell
- **Connected Universe**: Everything you do in Quack World strengthens your competitive performance in other game modes
